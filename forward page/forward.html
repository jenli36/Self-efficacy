      <p class="para firstpara">Have you ever have a moment when you doubted your educational skill sets?
      You feel like you don't belong to where you at and you are not smart enough or simply
      not good enough?

      <p class="para">The experience you had is closely tied to the idea of “self-efficacy”. 
        This is what we are trying to address through our project!
        Self-efficacy is the belief we have in our own abilities, specifically our 
        ability to meet the challenges ahead of us and complete a task successfully!
      </p>

      <p class="para">Studies show that compared with students who doubt their learning capabilities, 
          those who feel efficacious for learning or performing a task participate development of 
          academic self-efficacy more readily, work harder, persist longer when they encounter 
          difficulties and achieve at a higher level.

      <p class="para">Within competitive majors, you are in (CSE) low self-efficacy is prevalent among students. 
        The stair installations, which can be found in Gates Centers, show the volume just how many 
        people struggle with low-self-efficacy in hopes to bring awareness to encourage dialogue about 
        low self-efficacy.

      <p class="para">We have gathered some information about the definition of self-efficacy, negative-effects

        your career and academic pursue.
