        like you don't belong and are not smart enough in your academic cohort?

      <p class="para">The experience you had is closely tied to the idea of “low self-efficacy”,
          a topic we are trying to raise awareness of and address through our project. Self-efficacy 
          is the belief we have in our own abilities, specifically our ability to meet the challenges 
          ahead of us and complete a task successfully!

          self-efficacy is prevalent among students. The stair installations, which can be found in 
          the Gates Centers, show the volume just how many people struggle with low-self-efficacy in 
          hopes to bring awareness to encourage dialogue about low self-efficacy.

      <p class="boldpara">Why should you care about self-efficacy? </p>

      <p class="para">Studies show that compared to students who doubt their learning capabilities, 
        those with a higher sense of self-efficacy have the ability to work harder and persist longer 
        when they encounter difficulties and achieve at a higher level.
