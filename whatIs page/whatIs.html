            <p>Self-efficacy is the belief in your ability in performing tasks successfully. 
                It is your personal sense of competence, efficiency, and the ability to cope 
                with hardships and challenges.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="righthalf">
            <p>Your sense of self-efficacy begins to form in early childhood, as you deal 
                with a variety of experiences, tasks, and situations. Your sense of self-efficacy 
                evolves as you learn, experience, and develop both physically and mentally.
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes it’s challenging to differentiate self-efficacy from other colloquial 
                terms we use on a daily basis such as self-esteem, confidence and motivation and 
                resilience.The information below shows how self-efficacy differs from each of these terms.

                <div>
                    <h3 class="subsection">SELF-EFFICACY VS.<br>SELF-ESTEEM</h3>
                    <p>Self-esteem is conceptualized as a sort of general or overall feeling 
                        of one’s worth or value (Neill, 2005). While <u>self-esteem</u> is focused more on “being” 
                        (e.g., feeling that you are perfectly acceptable as you are), self-efficacy is more focused 
                        on “doing” (e.g., feeling that you are up to a challenge)<br><br>
                        Although high self-worth can definitely improve one’s sense of self-efficacy, 
                        as high self-efficacy can contribute to one’s sense of overall value or worth, the two stand 
                        as separate constructs.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="subsection">SELF-EFFICACY VS.<br>MOTIVATION</h3>
                        <p>Similarly, although self-efficacy and motivation are deeply entwined, they are also two 
                            separate constructs. Self-efficacy is based on an individual’s belief in their own capacity 
                            to achieve, while <u>motivation</u> is based on the individual’s desire to achieve. Clearly, those 
                            with high self-efficacy likely have high motivation and vice versa, but it is not a direct 
                            correlation.
                        </p>

                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div>
                        <h3 class="subsection">SELF-EFFICACY VS.<br>RESILIENCE</h3>
                        <p>Although self-efficacy is also positively related to confidence, the term 
                            confidence is more general than self-efficacy. While confidence refers to your strength of beliefs, 
                            self-efficacy refers specifically to your belief in your in your competence and capabilities 
                            (Bandura, 1997, p. 382).<br><br>
                            Just as with self-esteem and motivation, self-efficacy and confidence can work in a positive cycle–he 
                            more confident a person is in their abilities, the more likely they  are to succeed, which provides them  
                            with experiences to further develop their self-efficacy.
                        </p>

                    <div class="righthalf">
                        <h3>SELF-EFFICACY VS.<br>CONFIDENCE</h3>
                        <p>Similarly, although self-efficacy and motivation are deeply entwined, 
                            they are also two separate constructs. Self-efficacy is based on an individual’s belief in 
                            their own capacity to achieve, while motivation is based on the individual’s desire to achieve. 
                            Clearly, those with high self-efficacy likely have high motivation and vice versa, but it is not 
                            a direct correlation.<br><br>
                            However, they still generally get a boost in motivation to continue learning and making progress 
                            (Mayer, 2010). The relationship can also work in the other direction to create a sort of success 
                            cycle–hen an individual is highly motivated to learn and succeed, they are more likely to achieve 
                            their goals, giving them an experience that contributes to their overall self-efficacy.

            <h2>What shapes your <br>Self-Efficacy?</h2>
            <p id="shortpara">Self-efficacy can be developed and formed in more multiple ways. Four major components 
                that heavily influence your self-efficacy are: mastery experience, social modeling, verbal 
                persuasion, and psychological response.

                    <h3>1. Master Experience</h3>
                    <p>Mastery experiences refer to the idea that successful experiences help people to build up 
                        confidences and strength to overcome challenges. <br><br>
                        <strong>Sample</strong>: Sam, once participated in a Hackathon, and wins the final challenge. This mastery 
                        experience boosts Sam’s self-efficacy. As a result, Sam is actively looking for new Hackathon 
                        to challenge himself and is assured in his skill as a Computer Scientist

                    <h3>2. Social Modeling</h3>
                    <p>Social Modeling refers to the idea that through observing  people similar to oneself succeed,
                            it raises the observer’s belief that they too have the capabilities to succeed.<br><br>
                        <strong>Sample</strong>:  Linda is an international student from China and she is not comfortable with her 
                        English skills. However, Linda’s classmate Jack is who is also from China and is fluent in 
                        English shares his experience with Linda and the challenges he overcame throughout the years. 
                        Seeing Jack’s success today, Linda is willing to challenge herself and believes that she can 
                        also  overcome the language barrier one day.

                        <h3>3. Verbal Persuation</h3>
                        <p>Verbal persuasion refers to the idea that people could be persuaded to believe that they 
                            have the skills and capabilities to succeed by families, friends, instructors and so on.<br><br> 
                            <strong>Sample</strong>: John is struggling in his technical writing class, but his professor keeps on 
                            encouraging him through one on one conversations, writing assignments and always telling 
                            John that he can be a great writer if he put his minds into it. As a result, John never gave 
                            up on trying and ended up improving his writing skills and is now confident in his technical 
                            writing skills.

                        <h3>4. Psychological Response</h3>
                        <p>Psychological responses refers to the idea that moods, emotional states, physical reactions,
                             and stress levels can all impact how a person feels about their personal abilities in a particular 
                             situation.<br><br>
                             <strong>Sample</strong> Amy always wants to learn a new programming language and attempts to teach herself during 
                             the school year. Due to heavy workloads from school and social events, Amy becomes highly stressed 
                             and isn’t able to focus, becoming frequently frustrated when she encounters challenges during her 
                             learning process. When Amy tries again during her summer break, she finds her learning more enjoyable 
                             and has more patience to troubleshoot when she encounters challenges.
