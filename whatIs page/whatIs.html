        </div>
        <div class="second">
            <p class="bold">"Self-efficacy is the belief in your ability in performing tasks successfully. 
                Self-efficacy is a sense of competence, efficiency, and the ability to cope 
                with life."
            </p>
            <p class="light">Your sense of self-efficacy begins to form in early childhood, as you deal 
                with a variety of experiences, tasks, and situations. Your sense of self-efficacy 
                evolves as you learn, experience, and develop both physically and mentally.
            </p>
            <p class="light">Sometimes it’s challenging to differentiate self-efficacy from other colloquial 
                terms we use on a daily basis such as self-esteem, confidence and motivation and 
                resilience.The information below shows how self-efficacy differs from each of these terms.

                                <p class="slidetext">Similarly, although self-efficacy and motivation are deeply entwined, they are also two separate constructs.
                                     Self-efficacy is based on an individual’s belief in their own capacity to achieve, while motivation is based on the individual’s desire to achieve. 
                                     Clearly, those with high self-efficacy likely have high motivation and vice versa, but it is not a direct correlation.

                        they are also more likely to bounce back and recover from failure. This is the ability at the heart of resilience, 
                        and it is greatly impacted by self-efficacy.

        <h3 class="boldtitle">Self-Efficacy Development</h3>
        <p class="lightpara">Self-efficacy can be developed and formed in more multiple ways. Four major components 
            that heavily influence your self-efficacy are mastery experience, social modeling, verbal 
            persuasion, and psychological response.

                    <p class="eachtext">Mastery experiences refer to the idea that successful experiences help people to build up 
                        confidences and strength to overcome challenges. <br><br>
                        <strong>Sample</strong>: Sam, once participated in a Hackathon, and wins the final challenge. This mastery 
                        experience boosts Sam’s self-efficacy. As a result, Sam is actively looking for new Hackathon 
                        to challenge himself and is assured in his skill as a Computer Scientist.

                    <p class="eachtext">Social Modeling refers to the idea that through observing  people similar to oneself succeed,
                            it raises the observer’s belief that they too have the capabilities to succeed.<br><br>
                        <strong>Sample</strong>:  Linda is an international student from China and she is not comfortable with her 
                        English skills. However, Linda’s classmate Jack is who is also from China and is fluent in 
                        English shares his experience with Linda and the challenges he overcame throughout the years. 
                        Seeing Jack’s success today, Linda is willing to challenge herself and believes that she can 
                        also  overcome the language barrier one day.

                        <p class="eachtext">Verbal persuasion refers to the idea that people could be persuaded to believe that they 
                            have the skills and capabilities to succeed by families, friends, instructors and so on.<br><br> 
                            <strong>Sample</strong>: John is struggling in his technical writing class, but his professor keeps on 
                            encouraging him through one on one conversations, writing assignments and always telling 
                            John that he can be a great writer if he put his minds into it. As a result, John never gave 
                            up on trying and ended up improving his writing skills and is now confident in his technical 
                            writing skills.

                             and stress levels can all impact how a person feels about their personal abilities in a particular 
                             situation.<br><br>
                             <strong>Sample</strong>: Amy always wants to learn a new programming language and attempts to teach herself during 
                             the school year. Due to heavy workloads from school and social events, Amy becomes highly stressed 
                             and isn’t able to focus, becoming frequently frustrated when she encounters challenges during her 
                             learning process. When Amy tries again during her summer break, she finds her learning more enjoyable 
                             and has more patience to troubleshoot when she encounters challenges.
