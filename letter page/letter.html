            <p>We are a group of UW Design, Informatics, and CSE students who are passionate about 
                raising awareness of low self-efficacy, as we also personally struggle with this issue. 
                We can all recall moments when we have doubted our educational skill sets and feel like 
                we don't belong in our academic cohort. This feeling of self-doubt can progress and evolve 
                into something that is detrimental to our mental health and physical well-being. As a result, 
                we feel like it was our responsibility as fellow students to address the severity and prevalence 
                of low self-efficacy.
            </p>
        
            <p>It is our hope that our interactive installation will break the ice and encourage 
                dialogue among CSE students about a topic that is generally hard to talk about, while showing 
                individuals that they are not the only ones who struggle with self-efficacy.
            </p>
        
            <p>Apart from the installation experience, we wanted to equip students with the resources 
                and knowledge they need to tackle low self-efficacy so they can strongly advance in their academic 
                and career endeavors.  
            </p>
        
            <p>Please share this website to your friends to help each other overcome and encourage 
                dialogue about low-self-efficacy.</p>
        
            <p>Created with Love,</p>
