        </div>
        <div class="second">
            <p class="bold quote">&ldquo;Self-efficacy is the belief in your ability in performing tasks successfully. 
                Self-efficacy is a sense of competence, efficiency, and the ability to cope 
                with life.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p class="light">Your sense of self-efficacy begins to form in early childhood, as you deal 
                with a variety of experiences, tasks, and situations. Your sense of self-efficacy 
                evolves as you learn, experience, and develop both physically and mentally.
            </p>
            <p class="light">Sometimes it’s challenging to differentiate self-efficacy from other colloquial 
                terms we use on a daily basis such as self-esteem, confidence and motivation and 
                resilience. The information below shows how self-efficacy differs from each of these terms.

                        <p class="slidetext">While experiences of success certainly make up a large portion of self-efficacy 
                            development, there is also room for failure. Those with a high level of self-efficacy are not only 
                            more likely to succeed, they are also more likely to bounce back and recover from failure. 
                            This is the ability at the heart of resilience, and it is greatly impacted by self-efficacy.

                        <p class="slidetext">Although self-efficacy is also positively related to confidence, the term confidence 
                            is more general than self-efficacy. While confidence refers to your strength of beliefs, self-efficacy 
                            refers specifically to your belief in your in your competence and capabilities (Bandura, 1997, p. 382).

                            <p class="slidetext">Self-esteem is conceptualized as a sort of general or overall feeling of one’s worth or value 
                            (Neill, 2005). While self-esteem is focused more on “being” (e.g., feeling that you are perfectly acceptable as 
                            you are), self-efficacy is more focused on “doing” (e.g., feeling that you are up to a challenge).

                        <p class="slidetext">Similarly, although self-efficacy and motivation are deeply entwined, they are also 
                            two separate constructs. Self-efficacy is based on an individual’s belief in their own capacity to achieve, 
                            while motivation is based on the individual’s desire to achieve. Clearly, those with high self-efficacy likely 
                            have high motivation and vice versa, but it is not a direct correlation.
