            <p id="intro" style="display: inline;">Self-efficacy is defined by Bandura as “the belief in your ability in performing tasks successfully, and that self-efficacy as a sense of competence, efficiency, and the ability to cope with life”.
              Self-efficacy beliefs begin to form in early childhood as the child deals with a variety of experiences, tasks and situations. The development of self-efficacy beliefs continue throughout life as people learn, experience and develop into more complex human beings.</p>

        <p>Self-efficacy is an individual’s belief in their innate ability to achieve goals. Albert Bandura defines it as a personal judgment of 
            “how well one can execute courses of action required to deal with prospective situations”. </p>
